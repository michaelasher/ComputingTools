# Notes for September 26. Using Github.
- `git push` will send my file to the GitHub "cloud"
- `git pull` will pull the changes of my collaborator to my computer.
- When collaborating through GitHub it is common to have conflicts, as collaborators edit the same file.
- To add a remote location, use this code:

```
git remote add origin git@github.com:UWMadison-computingtools-2018/zmays-snps.git
```

And here's a link to [google](google.com). Hooray!
